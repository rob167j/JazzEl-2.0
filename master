The revised version of `jazzel_master_control.py` has added print statements to provide feedback when restarting services and allows for customizable service names and monitoring intervals. Here is the updated code:

```python
import os
import time

def restart_services(service_name="jazzel"):
    print(f"Restarting {service_name} service...")
    os.system(f"sudo systemctl restart {service_name}")
    print(f"{service_name} service restarted.")

def monitor_health(interval=300):
    while True:
        print("Jazz-El is monitoring systems...")
        time.sleep(interval)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    restart_services()
    monitor_health()
```

This version now prints messages when restarting services and allows you to specify the service name and health monitoring interval.
